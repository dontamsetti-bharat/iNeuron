#------Answer 1-------
#Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a
#multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed
#in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

#Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm.
pi=3.14
diameter = int(input("Enter Diameter of the sphere : "));
radius = diameter/2
volume = 4/3 * pi * radius**3
print("The volume of the sphere with diameter " + str(diameter) + " is " + str(volume) + " cubic cm")
